Sarah: Hello Jason, how are you, it's been a long time since we last met?
Jason: Oh, hi Sarah I'm have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
Sarah: Not too bad English.
Jason: How often do you eat at this cafe?
Sarah: This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
Jason: I have been so busy with my new job that I have not had the time to do much else, but otherwise, me and the family are all fine.
Sarah: Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
Jason: Yes you too.
